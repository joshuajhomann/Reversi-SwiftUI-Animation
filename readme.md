# Sample project Learn Swift LA and Swift Coders LA Meetups on 6-Jan-2020.

## `Animations swiftUI.playground`
A series of playgrounds exploring different aspects of SwiftUI animations:
* `UIKit` a playground showing an imperative animation in UIKit
* `Implicit` a playground showing an implicit animation that occurs when a view changes for any reason
* `Timing Curves` and `Springs`: visualizations of the various timing curves in SwiftUI
* `Explict` & `Explict2`: demonstrations of explicit animations to independently animate different aspects of a view
* `Transition`: a playground showing the use of `AnyTransition` to animate views in and out of the view hierarchy
* `MatchedGeometryEffect`: a playground showing how to perform a sematic move between different nodes in the view hierarchy by using a `matchedGeometryEffect`
* `AnimatableModifier`: a custom sine wave and color interpolating `AnimatableModifier`

## Reversi
An implementation of Reversi showing some of the animation techniques from the above playgrounds.
